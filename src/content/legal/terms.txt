FilePad Terms of Service

By installing or using FilePad ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

1. The App
FilePad is a macOS utility that adds Finder Services for video compression and a lightweight FilePad strip for batch jobs. The App processes files locally on your Mac.

2. License
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for its intended purpose. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

3. Your Responsibilities
You are responsible for the files you select and the results you generate. Ensure you have the right to process and store the files you compress.

4. Local Processing
Compression runs locally on your Mac. Output files are saved next to the originals with a "-compressed" suffix (or similar when naming collisions occur).

5. Availability and Updates
We may update or modify the App at any time. Features may change or be removed. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.

6. Disclaimer
The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, or profits arising from use of the App.

8. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
